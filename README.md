# Algorithm Visualizer
Personal project made as practice for sorting algorithms and basic visualization using Python + Pygame.

This is not intended to be a library, a product, or a polished demo.
It’s a sandbox to understand how the algorithms work internally.

## What it is

A simple application that:

Generates a random list of values

Applies different sorting algorithms

Visualizes each step of the process

Allows full execution or step-by-step execution

## Implemented algorithms

Bubble Sort

Selection Sort

Insertion Sort

Quick Sort

Merge Sort

Bogo Sort (just for fun)

All algorithms are implemented using yield so intermediate states can be visualized.

## Controls

Select algorithm: top buttons

RUN: run the selected algorithm

STEP: advance one step

STOP: stop execution and restore visual state

RESET: generate a new random list

## Project goals

Practice classic sorting algorithms

Understand algorithm flow step by step

Explore real-time visualization

Experiment with generators and state management

Not focus on perfonmance

Extensible architecture

Production-level polish
