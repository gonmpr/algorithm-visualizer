# Algorithm Visualizer
Personal project made as practice for sorting algorithms and basic visualization using Python + Pygame.

This is not intended to be a library, a product, or a polished demo.
It’s a sandbox to understand how the algorithms work internally.

- The colors indicate the values ​​that are being compared, swaped or being used as pivot

## What it is

A simple application that:

- Generates a random list of values

- Applies different sorting algorithms

- Visualizes each step of the process

- Allows full execution or step-by-step execution

## Implemented algorithms

Bubble Sort

Selection Sort

Insertion Sort

Quick Sort

Merge Sort

Bogo Sort (just for fun)

All algorithms are implemented using yield so intermediate states can be visualized.

## Controls

- Select algorithm: top buttons

- RUN: run the selected algorithm

- STEP: advance one step

- STOP: stop execution and restore visual state

- RESET: generate a new random list

## Project goals

Practice classic sorting algorithms.
Understand algorithm flow step by step.
Explore real-time visualization.
Experiment with generators and state management.

### Not a focus

- performance

- Extensible architecture

- Production-level polish
